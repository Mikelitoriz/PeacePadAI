have in your child custody agreement or parenting plan. I've been a child custody attorney for over 20 years, and I serve five years on the bench as judge, and I can tell you that you must have these four things in your custody agreement or parenting plan. Number one, what overnights and partial days will you and your ex have during the course of the week or month? You could do the basic one week on one week off or every other weekend. Or you can get creative like a 223, or a two to five schedule. Number two, what times will the exchanges take place? General language like after school or after daycare work great, but you need specific times for the days that your kids aren't in school or daycare. Number three, holidays, be sure to include specific times, and make sure you indicate that holiday schedule supersedes the regular schedule. And number four, vacations, how much time will each party get and how and when will notice be given? Don't forget to follow for more, here are four things you.
