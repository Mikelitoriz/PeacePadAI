üß© PeacePadAI ‚Äî ‚ÄúMedia UI & Find Support Enhancement Iteration‚Äù

1. ü™™ Fix Sign-Out Functionality
Observation:
The sign-out button does not fully clear session data or redirect smoothly on production.
Instruction:
Fix the sign-out process so that when a user logs out, the session clears immediately from localStorage and DB session (if active), then cleanly redirects to the login or home screen without needing manual refresh.

2. üé® UI Alignment & Professional Layout
Observation:
Icons (record, attach, audio, call, etc.) are not uniformly aligned or visually stable across screen sizes.
Instruction:
Reformat all icons using consistent padding, spacing, and responsive scaling (Flexbox/Grid).
Ensure layout matches professional apps (WhatsApp/Google Chat standards).
Icons must appear balanced, clean, and touch-friendly across mobile and desktop.

3. üé• Video & Audio Recording ‚Äî Improved UX Flow
Observations:
- Camera view not showing properly during recording.
- No progress or stop dialog when recording audio/video.
- Recordings send immediately, no review/crop option.
Instruction:
Ensure camera preview displays before recording starts.
Add a small recording dialog showing progress + stop button.
After stopping, show a preview panel where users can trim or crop video/audio before sending.
UI should mimic a professional recording interface ‚Äî clean, intuitive, stable.

4. üåç Therapist Finder ‚Äî Expand Postal Code Coverage
Observation:
Therapist search currently focuses only on the M9W Toronto postal area.
Instruction:
Expand the Therapist API search to cover all of Canada and the U.S.
Use a free, reliable open-data source (e.g., OpenCanada for CA postal codes, Data.gov for U.S. ZIPs).
Display results with province/state, city, and postal code.
Optimize lookup speed with caching or indexing.

5. üß≠ Find Support Section ‚Äî Same Expansion Logic
Observation:
Find Support (formerly Seek Help) has limited postal coverage.
Instruction:
Apply the same Canada/U.S.-wide postal lookup logic to the Find Support section.
Ensure users can find the nearest clinics, mediators, or family centers across all regions.

‚úÖ Summary for Replit Prompt
Please fix the sign-out bug, align all icons uniformly, and enhance the video/audio recording flow with a professional camera preview, progress bar, and crop-before-send option.
Expand the Therapist and Find Support postal coverage to all Canada and U.S. postal codes using free open-data APIs. Keep the interface neat, efficient, and cost-optimized.
