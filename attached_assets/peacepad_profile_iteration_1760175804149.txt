📱 PeacePadAI — “Profile Emoji, Picture & Mobile UI Optimization Iteration”

🎯 Goal
Enhance user personalization and ensure PeacePadAI’s UI looks and works seamlessly across mobile devices (Android & iPhone). 
This iteration focuses on improving profile setup (emoji/photo), fixing emoji rendering, stabilizing uploads, and ensuring full mobile compatibility.

🪪 1. Profile Setup Enhancement
During the soft login screen (nickname or guest mode), users should be able to:
- Choose a profile emoji (emoji picker).
- Or upload a profile photo (PNG/JPEG).

Implementation Notes:
- Add emoji picker and file upload input (accept="image/*").
- Compress uploaded images (client-side) before saving.
- Save emoji/photo in localStorage linked to the session ID.
- Assign random emoji (🌞, 🌻, 🦋, ✨) if none chosen.

💬 2. Profile Display Across UI
Display user emoji/photo consistently:
- Top Bar: beside PeacePadAI logo or chat header → Mama 🙋‍♀️
- Chat Bubbles: show small circular avatar beside each message.
- Sidebar (if present): mini avatar next to active chat or contact list.

🧠 3. Backend & Data Handling
- Store emoji/photo reference in session data (no heavy storage).
- Use base64-encoded images for temporary profiles.
- Keep design ready for future persistent (hard-auth) accounts.

🧰 4. Troubleshooting Fixes
- Fix broken emoji rendering (UTF-8 + Noto Color Emoji font).
- Stabilize image upload flow (include upload progress + retry).
- Add graceful fallbacks for failed uploads (e.g., “Upload failed, please retry”).

📱 5. Mobile Optimization (NEW)
Ensure the interface is fully responsive and user-friendly on Android and iPhone.

Requirements:
- Use responsive CSS grid/flex layouts that scale properly across all screen widths.
- Ensure all icons, emoji pickers, upload buttons, and chat bubbles fit correctly within mobile viewports.
- Test and adjust keyboard overlap when typing.
- Floating buttons (record, send) remain visible and tappable.
- Camera and mic permissions for in-app recording on iOS Safari and Android Chrome.
- Optimize for touch gestures (scroll, tap, long press) with no layout shift or hidden buttons.

✅ Deliverables
- [ ] Emoji/photo selection on login
- [ ] Profile display across chat areas
- [ ] Fixed emoji rendering and upload flow
- [ ] Responsive mobile layout for Android + iPhone
