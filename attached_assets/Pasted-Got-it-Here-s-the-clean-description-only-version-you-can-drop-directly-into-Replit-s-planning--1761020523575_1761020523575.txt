üß© Description for Replit ‚Äî Mock AI Integration (DEV Mode Only)

Objective:
Expand PeacePad‚Äôs mock AI response system to simulate realistic mediation feedback for testing and development environments without incurring token or API costs.

Context:
During development (DEV mode), PeacePad currently uses a placeholder AI response. This update should introduce a structured, scalable mock AI dataset that produces intelligent, varied responses for chat, tone, and mediation use cases, without external API calls.

Key Requirements:
	1.	Mock AI Database (Local or Lightweight):
	‚Ä¢	Create a local or lightweight database of predefined tone and context-based responses.
	‚Ä¢	Include diverse categories such as parenting, scheduling, expenses, co-parenting tone analysis, and emotional regulation prompts.
	‚Ä¢	Each response should feel natural and context-aware, representing how PeacePad‚Äôs AI mediator would respond in production.
	2.	Dynamic Simulation Logic:
	‚Ä¢	The system should automatically choose responses based on detected message tone, keywords, or conversation context.
	‚Ä¢	Simulated tone detection and mediation suggestions should still mimic AI intelligence.
	‚Ä¢	The logic should be scalable so more mock responses can be added easily over time.
	3.	Environment Toggle:
	‚Ä¢	PeacePad should switch between Mock AI (DEV) and Live AI (PROD) using environment flags (e.g., AI_MODE=MOCK or AI_MODE=LIVE).
	‚Ä¢	No hardcoded API calls or dependencies ‚Äî just logical separation that Replit can manage internally.
	4.	Production Configuration:
	‚Ä¢	When switched to production, the app should default to using a lighter AI model (e.g., GPT 3.5 Turbo or 4o-mini) instead of the main GPT-4.4 model, to reduce token cost.
	‚Ä¢	The system should cache or store frequently used responses to minimize repeated API calls.
	5.	Development Goals:
	‚Ä¢	Ensure mock responses are consistent, cost-free, and representative of real AI tone and flow.
	‚Ä¢	Mock AI should integrate seamlessly into the chat, call, and tone analysis systems during testing.
	‚Ä¢	Replit should handle the mock AI logic generation and data storage approach dynamically ‚Äî without static or hardcoded references.

Would you like me to add a short Replit iteration title + summary line (like the ones you‚Äôve used before) so you can paste it directly into the Replit ‚ÄúPlan‚Äù section?
