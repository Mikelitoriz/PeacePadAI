🧩 PeacePadAI — “Shareable Call Session ID Iteration”

🎯 Goal
Introduce a shareable session ID and link feature for PeacePadAI’s real-time audio/video calls, similar to Microsoft Teams or Zoom. This will allow users to share active call sessions easily and let others join through a simple join interface.

📞 1. Session ID & Link Generation
Description:
When a user starts a new call (audio or video), the app should automatically generate a unique session ID and join link.

Requirements:
- Each call session gets a unique session_id (UUID-based).
- Display the session ID clearly during the call (e.g., top corner or info button).
- Create a shareable join link such as:
  https://peace-pad-ai-2rqkkxbq5g.replit.app/join/<session_id>
- Include a “Copy Link” and “Share” button (integrating with native sharing for mobile).

🌐 2. Join Flow (Like Teams/Zoom)
Description:
When a person clicks a shared session link, they are redirected to a Join Page.

Requirements:
- The page shows:
  - “Enter your name” field (default Guest### if blank).
  - Camera preview toggle (on/off).
  - Microphone toggle (mute/unmute).
  - “Join Session” button to connect to the ongoing call.
- Connection happens using WebRTC peer discovery via the same session ID.

🔒 3. Permissions & Stability
Requirements:
- Ensure smooth camera and mic permission prompts before joining.
- Maintain stable connection handoff even if multiple users join.
- Display error message if session ID is invalid or expired.

🧠 4. Integration
Backend:
- Extend WebSocket signaling server to accept new join requests using session_id.
- Store active sessions temporarily in memory (or Redis if supported).
- Add cleanup logic to remove inactive sessions.

Frontend:
- Update call component UI to include:
  - Session ID display
  - “Share” & “Copy Link” buttons
  - Conditional rendering for Join Page vs. Active Call

🧩 5. Deliverables
- [ ] Working session link and join interface
- [ ] Session ID visible and shareable
- [ ] Functional toggles for camera and mic
- [ ] Smooth redirect for shared links
- [ ] Graceful error handling for invalid sessions

✅ Summary for Replit Prompt
Implement a shareable session link and ID system for PeacePadAI calls. Each call should generate a unique session_id and a join link that can be shared via text or social media. When another person clicks the link, they should land on a Join Page where they can enter a name, toggle camera/mic, and join the session in progress. Maintain connection stability and display errors gracefully if the link is invalid.
