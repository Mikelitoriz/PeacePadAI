# PeacePad - Co-Parenting Communication Platform

## Overview
PeacePad is an AI-powered co-parenting communication platform designed to foster constructive dialogue between separated parents. It utilizes AI for tone analysis to reduce tension and promote effective communication. Inspired by applications like Linear, Headspace, and Notion, PeacePad offers a calming and accessible interface, providing real-time messaging, shared task management, collaborative note-taking, and child update tracking. The platform aims to facilitate smoother co-parenting relationships and has potential for broader market adoption in family communication tools.

### Onboarding Experience
- **Streamlined Introductory Slideshow**: 3-slide welcome experience for first-time visitors (down from 7 for faster onboarding); covers Welcome message, Key Features overview (chat, scheduling, expenses, support), and Get Started CTA; uses embla-carousel with smooth transitions, skip button, progress indicators, and localStorage "hasSeenIntro" flag to show once per visitor; mobile-optimized with responsive design; automatically bypassed for users with pending call join codes.

## User Preferences
Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Technology Stack**: React 18, TypeScript, Vite, Wouter for routing, TanStack Query for state management, Radix UI primitives with shadcn/ui, Tailwind CSS.
- **Design System**: Custom calming color palette, Inter and JetBrains Mono fonts, comprehensive theme support, accessibility-first approach.
- **Component Architecture**: Modular design with shared UI components, feature-specific components, and page-level components.

### Backend Architecture
- **Technology Stack**: Node.js, Express.js, TypeScript, ES Modules, Drizzle ORM, PostgreSQL (Neon serverless).
- **API Design**: RESTful API, Replit Auth middleware, consistent error handling, request/response logging.
- **Data Models**: Users, Guest Sessions, Usage Metrics, Messages (with AI tone analysis and recipientId for 1:1 conversations), Notes, Tasks, Child Updates, Pets, Expenses, Events (with AI conflict detection), Sessions, Push Subscriptions.
- **Soft Authentication**: Guest entry with optional display name, unique localStorage session ID (14-day persistence), auto-generated guest IDs, no email/password required.
- **Conversation Scoping**: Messages include recipientId for proper 1:1 conversation privacy; auto-selected for 2-user scenarios, explicit selection required for 3+ users; retrieval filtered by `WHERE senderId = userId OR recipientId = userId`.

### Progressive Web App (PWA)
- **Configuration**: `manifest.json`, service worker for offline support, "Add to Home Screen" capability, standalone display mode.
- **Offline Capabilities**: Caches essential pages and assets; chat UI, tone feedback, and dashboard function offline with cached data.
- **Push Notifications**: Service worker-based push notifications for incoming calls; user-controlled subscription management, browser notification permission handling, backend storage of push subscriptions, web-push with VAPID keys (environment variables for production, development fallback keys included).

### AI Integration
- **OpenAI Integration**: GPT-3.5-turbo for real-time message tone analysis (calm, cooperative, neutral, frustrated, defensive, hostile, with rewording suggestions) and scheduling conflict detection.
- **Tone Analysis Design**: Low temperature (0.3) for consistent analysis, structured prompt engineering, graceful fallback.
- **Scheduling Conflict Detection**: Time-based overlap detection, AI analysis of patterns, actionable suggestions, visual warnings.

### Database Architecture
- **Provider**: Neon Serverless PostgreSQL with WebSocket-based connection pooling.
- **Schema Design**: UUID primary keys, `createdAt`/`updatedAt` timestamps, foreign key relationships, JSONB for session storage.
- **Migration Strategy**: Drizzle Kit for schema migrations, shared schema definitions (`/shared/schema.ts`).

### Development Workflow
- **Build Pipeline**: Vite for frontend, esbuild for backend, TypeScript compilation checking, shared types via `/shared`.
- **Path Aliases**: `@/*` (frontend), `@shared/*` (shared types), `@assets/*` (static assets).

### WebRTC Real-Time Communication
- **WebSocket Signaling Server**: Unified server for chat and WebRTC signaling, handles multiple connections, ICE candidate exchange.
- **Session-Based Multi-User Calls**: Session rooms support 2-12 participants; users join sessions via 6-digit code, server manages session user lists, broadcasts peer-joined/peer-left events.
- **Role-Based Negotiation**: Existing session members create offers to newcomers, newcomers wait to receive offers and send answers (prevents SDP glare in multi-user scenarios).
- **Media-Ready Gating**: Async getUserMedia initialization protected by `isMediaReady` flag; peer connections queued in `pendingPeersRef` if media not ready, processed after initialization to ensure tracks are always added before SDP negotiation.
- **Offer Caching System**: Incoming offers cached in `pendingOffersRef` if peer connection doesn't exist yet; offers applied and answered immediately after peer connection creation, preventing dropped negotiations from race conditions.
- **Voice/Video Calling**: WebRTC peer connections (Map for multiple peers), STUN server configuration, audio/video modes, call controls (mute, camera, end call), optional call recording (WebM).
- **Unauthenticated Join Flow**: Session lookup endpoint is public (no auth required); unauthenticated users can access shared call links, view session details and preview; when joining, stores pending_join_code in localStorage, redirects to landing for guest creation, auto-shows guest entry form, then auto-redirects to call preview after authentication.
- **Manual Join**: "Join Call" sidebar option allows manual 6-digit session code entry for both authenticated and unauthenticated users.

### Emotional Intelligence Features (PeacePadAI) - OPT-IN
**All wellness features are now opt-in (default OFF)** - Users must enable them in Settings to maintain a streamlined, communication-focused experience:
